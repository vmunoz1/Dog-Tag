								1. Blessed is the one
					who does not walk in step with the wicked
				or stand in the way that sinners take
					or sit in the company of mockers,
					<br>
					<br>
				2. but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
					and who meditates on his law day and night.
					<br>
					<br>
				3. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
					which yields its fruit in season
				and whose leaf does not witherâ€”
					whatever they do prospers.
					<br>
					<br>
	
				4. Not so the wicked!
					They are like chaff
					that the wind blows away.
					<br>
					<br>
				5. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
					nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
	
					<br>
					<br>
				6. For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
					but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
